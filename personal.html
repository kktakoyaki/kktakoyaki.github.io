								<div class="paragraph">Hello! My name is CAKWE.
										I'm a professional animator, illustrator, and graphic designer.
										
										I'm currently based in Bogor, Indonesia.
										While I'm currently focusing on my own art, I'm open to any work opportunities.
										For contact or other inquiries regarding serious work, you can reach me at this e-mail.

								<div><h2>> Wait, you're NOT a vtuber? </h2>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="image/icon-bw.png" alt="yaaay!" /></span>
								<b>TL;DR WELL, YES, BUT ACTUALLY, NO, I DON'T THINK I'M A VTUBER? AM I..??</b>
								<br><br>
								I started streaming my art on Twitch as a pngtuber / gif-tuber back in 2019.
								Then, when the "vtuber boom" happened, I watched tutorials on how to make a Live2D model, thinking I can offer that as a commission service.
								I made a sample Live2D model of my OC (original character for another personal project) and tried to stream with my sample model.
								<br><br>
								Streaming ended up being a very fun hobby.
								Since I offer art commissions, I often stream my process whenever possible.
								When I'm not doing creative stuff, I stream games and IRL!
								As time goes on, my audience ended up associating the name "CAKWE" with my OC Live2D model.
								<br><br>
								So yeah, I'm definitely a content creator, but I'm not sure if I'm a vtuber, because I don't roleplay as a character / voice act as the character you see on the screen.
								I'm just me, having fun on stream, maybe doing a bit / putting on an act to be funny sometimes. Yes, I do yap a lot, both on stream and IRL <del>not sorry tbh</del>

							<h2 id=name>> Why is your name CAKWE?</h2>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="image/cakwe.jpg" alt="yummy!" /></span>
									<div class="paragraph">Ê≤πÊù° (read: youtiao) is a golden-brown deep-fried strip of dough commonly eaten in China. 
									
									<a class="dotted" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youtiao">Click here for the Wikipedia article if you're curious.</a>

									It's a popular street food in East and Southeast Asia, and it's commonly referred to as "cakwe" in Indonesia. While I was abroad in the States, I miss eating this one particular food item, it ended up being my pen name.
									
									This pen name, "CAKWE" ‚Äî ended up becoming a reminder of my heritage and my nationality.

							<h2 id=recs>> can you recommend some anime series to watch?</h2>
								<a class="dotted" href="https://myanimelist.net/animelist/cakwe?order=4&order2=1&status=2">Click here to get redirected to My Anime List, sorted by score + alphabetically.</a>
								<br><br>
								The titles I've marked with a score of 8 ~ 9 are anime shows / series I think worth watching and recommend.
								Score of 7 means it's enjoyable for me, but I won't recommend it to my friends unless they like the genre / themes. Score of 6 means I disliked it and won't recommend it. 
								Please note that a lower score rating doesn't necessarily mean the anime's bad, and vice versa -- a high score doesn't mean it's a masterpiece.
								<br><br>
								Example: I really, <b>really</b> liked
								<a class="dotted" href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/35645/Uta_no%E2%98%86Prince-sama%E2%99%AA_Movie__Maji_Love_Kingdom>Uta no‚òÜPrince-sama‚ô™ Maji Love Kingdom Movie</a>
								and that was one of the BEST CINEMA EXPERIENCE I've ever had. Super fun and memorable.
								However, not everyone follows this series, and not everyone likes the idol genre.
								Oh, also? It's waaaay more hype when watching it on the big ass screen with 50 other people in that room
								Hence the score of 7 -- I won't recommend it to the general audience, but I would highly recommend it to someone who likes singing and dancing anime boys
								<s>and you just gotta be there for the full immersive experience</s>
								<br><br>
								These scores are given on a whim so do not ask me why 86 has a lower score than Osomatsu.
								It's not that serious (inb4 86 fans try not to <i>"this is the best anime i've ever watched"</i> challenge)
								also mostly because scoring depends on if I personally enjoyed it watching it or not.
