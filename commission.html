							<h2>General Rules</h2>
							<p><ul class="alt">
								<li><b>Will Do:</b> Will draw almost anything. Fanarts, OCs, OCs with characters from another series, furries (as for scalies, I admit I’ve never drawn one, but I’m super excited to try ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ let’s gooo), NSFW, violence, gore, certain specific fetishes.</li>
								<li><b>Will Do, with extra charge:</b> Multiple characters / group picture, detailed weapons and armors, complex machinery, details to the composition such as complex foreground and background.</li>
								<li><b>Won’t Do:</b> Ideas I’m not comfortable with, such as some certain specific fetishes or personal views on certain subject matters. Please do send me the details to your commission request, and I will let you know if I am willing to work on your commission order.</li>
								<li><b>Payment via Paypal / Jenius only.</b> I will send an invoice to you and will start working on the commission once I receive the payment. You may discuss payment plans with me.</li>
								<li><b>Updates:</b> You may contact me about the progress of your commission at any time, and I'll get back to you as soon as possible within 24 hours.</li>
								<li><b>Privacy:</b> I often stream my drawing process on Twitch. If you would rather keep your commission a secret, please let me know in advance so I won’t stream while working on your commission.</li>
								<li><b>Turnaround time:</b> Please give me two to five working days to complete your commission. If I need more time for your commission, I will let you know and give you an estimation of the time needed. Please also let me know in advance regarding deadlines.</li>
								<li><b>Revisions:</b> Before line work, I offer major revisions up to three times. Changing the pose and altering the layout are considered major revisions. After line work is done, I cannot offer major revisions. If you insist, extra charges will be incurred accordingly. 
									After coloring is done, the only minor changes I can offer you are color corrections and minor decorative additions to the picture. I may charge you for more revisions depending on how major the changes are / how many changes are made.</li>
